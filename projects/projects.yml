    The first objective of this study was to test the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of Serbian adaptations of the Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS-12) and the Short Cyberchondria Scale (SCS). The second aim was to test the direct effects of cyberchondria on pseudoscientific practices (PSP) and the use of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) as well as its indirect effects through conspiracy mentality (CMQ).

    Based on the compensatory internet use theory, hedonic or non-utilitarian smartphone use might be associated with SA. The study concludes that being female, hedonic smartphone use, and perceived life stress predict SA.

    The main distinctions between the two aspects of narcissism lie in the positive relations with Neuroticism and negative relations with self-esteem, both of which are higher for Narcissistic vulnerability. The results support good psychometric properties of the PNI scores and add to the PNI’s cross-cultural validity.
