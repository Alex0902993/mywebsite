	abstract = {Smartphones are a medium for performing online activities, and one such activity could be the compulsive online health information search — cyberchondria. This study aimed to test whether cyberchondria and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) positively predict smartphone addiction (SA), adjusted for age, gender, daily use duration, the reason for using smartphones, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. The sample consisted of 471 adults (55.2\% women) from the general population without chronic diseases (Mage = 38.67). Regression analysis showed that IU was a positive predictor of SA (β = .17, p {\textless} .001), as well as cyberchondria (β = .14, p {\textless} .001), which had a unique contribution to the explanation of SA, relative to IU. Other significant predictors were average daily smartphone use and entertainment use, the latter being the strongest predictor in the model. These results revealed cyberchondria as a unique predictor of SA.},

We tested the connections using structural equation modeling (SEM) on questionnaire data obtained from 410 participants (73.2\% women). Results indicated a good overall fit of the model (χ2(36) = 58.06, p = .011; CFI = 0.970, TLI = 0.954, RMSEA [90\% CI] = 0.039 [0.019, 0.056], SRMR = 0.037). Perceived stress and hedonic use were positive predictors of SA (β = 0.264, p = .001 and β = 0.176, p = .002, respectively). Satisfaction with life did not directly predict SA, but an indirect effect, via perceived stress, was statistically significant (β = − 0.146, p = .001). Women showed greater SA than men, but the effect of age was not significant. Perceived stress was negatively predicted by satisfaction with life, and positively by hedonic use. Based on the compensatory internet use theory, hedonic or non-utilitarian smartphone use might be associated with SA. The study concludes that being female, hedonic smartphone use, and perceived life stress predict SA.},

	abstract = {Cyberchondria is a pattern of repetitive search for health information online, which has adverse psychological consequences in spite of its intention to relieve anxiety. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in the current pandemic accompanied by increased levels of uncertainty and fear, which can lead to increased volume of health information search on the internet, as well as cyberchondria. The first objective of this study was to test the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of Serbian adaptations of the Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS-12) and the Short Cyberchondria Scale (SCS). The second aim was to test the direct effects of cyberchondria on pseudoscientific practices (PSP) and the use of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) as well as its indirect effects through conspiracy mentality (CMQ). The sample included 511 participants (73.6\% women) from Serbia, from the general population. The results support the adequate alpha reliabilities and four-factor structure of CSS-12 and the single-factor structure of SCS, as well as their positive correlations with health anxiety (HAQ), internet addiction (IAT), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCI-R Obsessions) and a negative correlation with self-esteem (a single-item scale). Additionally, the composite cyberchondria score had both direct and indirect effects on both questionable health practices. Our results revealed conspiracy mentality as one of the possible mechanisms through which cyberchondria is related to the use of PSP/CAM. It stems from distress related to cyberchondria and leads to an increased likelihood of adopting PSPs or CAM as a tool for maintaining a sense of control in an uncertain situation.},

	abstract = {The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Serbian Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (SABAS) and the original English version of the same scale administered to a Serbian-speaking sample. In Study 1, 599 participants completed Serbian SABAS, with 189 having both test and retest data. Results suggested good internal consistency (α = .81) and test–retest reliability (ICC = .795, p {\textless} .001, 95\% CI [.731, .844], rtest-retest = .803) of the scale. Convergent validity of the SABAS was evaluated through correlations with the Smartphone Addiction Scale–Short Version (SAS-SV), as well as with anxiety, depression, worry, duration, and purpose of smartphone use. Divergent validity of the SABAS was evaluated through comparing the correlations with entertainment and productive smartphone use. The modified CFA model showed an acceptable fit (χ2(8) = 25.53, p = .001, CFI = .961, TLI = .926, RMSEA = .096, SRMR = .042), confirming the unidimensionality of the SABAS. In the second study, the English SABAS, completed by 335 non-native speakers from Serbia, also showed a good fit of the single-factor model (χ2(9) = 12.56, p = .184, CFI = .990, TLI = .984, RMSEA = .036, SRMR = 0.026), and good psychometric features. Based on the study’s findings, the Serbian version of SABAS is a reliable and valid measure for screening the risk of smartphone addiction. Moreover, the English version can be used among non-native Serbian English speakers.},

Further, scalar invariance between the two versions of the PNI was achieved. Relations between Narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability and other measures of grandiose and hypersensitive narcissism supported the validity of their scores. Among HEXACO traits, both Narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability showed substantial negative correlations with Honesty-Humility. The main distinctions between the two aspects of narcissism lie in the positive relations with Neuroticism and negative relations with self-esteem, both of which are higher for Narcissistic vulnerability.

This intervention study aimed to assess the efficacy of a specific 16-week exercise program in improving functions as measured by the Fullerton Functional Fitness Test (FFFT), also known as the Senior Test, in older adults. Participants: Thirty-eight participants (66 \% women, Mage = 80.15, SD = 7.21) were randomized into an exercise group (n = 24) and a waiting list control group (n = 14). The exercise group trained three times a week for 1 h.
Methods: Objective tests (FFFT and handgrip power) and subjective psychological measures (life satisfaction, resilience, happiness, perceived stress, and well-being) were obtained at baseline, after eight weeks, and after 16 weeks. The data were analyzed using mixed-effect regression models.
Results: The results yielded statistically significant group-by-time interactions in all models, indicating improvements in physical and psychological measures over time in the treatment group compared to the control group. Significant differences between the groups in the estimated marginal means (with adjusted 95 \% confidence intervals) emerged after 16 weeks in happiness ( 3.5 [-6.5, 0.4]), resilience ( 5.5 [-9.9, 1.2]), perceived stress (2.2 [0.2, 4.2]), well-being ( 5.8 [-7.9, 3.6]), upper limb strength ( 5.7 [-9.0, 2.4]), upper body flexibility ( 8.7 [-16.4, 1.0]), and agility and balance (4.6 [1.2, 8.1]). Except for happiness and resilience, these differences surfaced already after eight weeks.
Conclusion: The here-employed 16-week exercise program, targeting the test elements of the FFFT, efficiently induced physical and mental improvements in older adults.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: The Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), based on the components model addictions, is a 6-item instrument used to assess the risk of exercise addiction (REA). Its revised version (EAI-R) was published in 2019 but only differed from the original scale in the response rating range (using a 6-point rather than 5-point Likert scale). In 2023, the EAI-3 was released with two new items (guilt when missing training and exercising despite injury). We aimed to test the validity and reliability of the Hungarian EAI-3 (EAI-3-HU). Methods: We tested 507 regular exercisers (Mage = 38.7 years, SDage = 10.63 years, rangeage: 18–78 years; 62.7\% females) who completed the EAI-3-HU, the obsessive passion subscale of the Passion Scale, and exercise habits questions on the online Qualtrics research platform during autumn/winter 2023–2024. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis resulted in a good model fit for the two factor EAI-3-HU (CFI = .96; TLI = .94; RMSEA = .07; SRMR = .04). However, the covariance between the latent factors was .97, indicating that they measure an identical concept. Thus, a single-factor solution was appropriate (CFI = .96; TLI = .94; RMSEA = .07; SRMR = .04). Testing measurement invariance revealed the partial scalar invariance across genders. The internal reliability of the scale was good (Cronbach’s α = .81). The scale had good convergent validity with obsessive passion (r = .72), and discriminant validity based on exercise frequency as well as exercise intensity (p {\textless} .001). Conclusion: The 8-item single factor EAI-3-HU adequately assesses the Hungarian samples’ REA. Nevertheless, it should be kept in perspective that the revised tool, like its predecessors, only assesses a level of ‘risk’, which does not imply morbidity, thus it has no clinical diagnostic value.},

	abstract = {Background: Feelings and emotions during sports and exercise determine commitment, adherence, and enjoyment of the activity. The Physical Activity Affect Scale (PAAS) combined two earlier instruments, the Exercise-Induced Feelings Inventory and the Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale, to investigate affective states generally characterizing post-exercise feelings based on the circumplex model of affect. Therefore, the PAAS measures positive affect, negative affect, fatigue, and tranquility on a five-point Likert scale having only 12 items. Aim: Its ease of administration and interpretation renders the PAAS a valuable tool in both research and practice, but it is unavailable to Hungarian scholars and sports and exercise professionals due to the lack of adaptation. Hence, this work aimed to develop and validate the Hungarian version of the PAAS. Methods: Three hundred sixty-two recreational exercisers (64.1\% women), aged from 18 to 62 (mean of age: 27.0 [SD = 10.0]) years completed the questionnaires before and during their exercise (briefly interrupting activity). Measures: PAAS was used to measure positive affect, negative affect, fatigue and tranquility aspects of internal affective experience. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was utilized to assess the actual mood state, consisting of positive affect and negative affect subscales. Arousal was measured with Felt Arousal Scale (FAS), while the pleasure–displeasure affective valence was assessed with the Feeling Scale (FS). Results: A confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit of the four-factor model. The results also revealed configural, metric, and scalar measurement invariance between sexes. The internal reliabilities of the scales varied between (Cronbach’s α) .73 and .85 before and during exercise. PAAS scales largely showed the expected associations with other measures of positive and negative affect and activation. The lowest association was between Tranquility (PAAS) and Felt arousal (r = .14), followed by Tranquility and Feeling (r = .27). Feeling and Felt arousal correlated negatively with Fatigue (PAAS, r = –.42 and r = –.44), as well as with the Negative affect (PAAS, r = –.61 and r = –.40). Positive affect from PAAS (PAAS PA) had a positive correlation with Feeling and Felt arousal (r = .64, r = .54). PAAS PA and Positive affect from PANAS (PANAS PA) correlated strongly (r = .77), similar to the Negative affect from both inventories (r = .78; p {\textless} .01 for all cases). Conclusion: Therefore, the Hungarian PAAS could assess exercise-induced affect in a reliable and valid way in recreational exercisers. However, its validity in competitive sports remains to be tested.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of falls in older individuals worldwide is around 26.5\%. There is an urgent need to identify factors antagonistic to advanced age-related falls regarding personal safety, family or nursing care time, and healthcare costs. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between functional fitness, mental health indicators, and the risk of falling (ROF) in older adults. Thirty-eight older adults (60–94 years; 66\% female) were tested individually with the Fullerton Functional Fitness Test (FFFT) after completing five instruments gauging resilience, well-being, satisfaction with life, happiness, and perceived stress. We measured the ROF with the Berg Balance Test. All objective and subjective measures correlated significantly with the ROF. Bayesian linear regressions revealed that complex movement coordination accounted for 68.8\%, while resilience accounted for 48.5\% of the variance in the ROF. Moreover, resilience was also a mediator between complex movement coordination and ROF. These results suggest that complex movement coordinationdeveloping and resilience-enhancing training strategies might be beneficial in reducing the ROF in older adults.},

	abstract = {Background Physical fitness and functioning are related to better mental health in older age. However, which fitness components (body composition, strength, flexibility, coordination, and endurance) are more closely related to psychological well-being (PWB) is unclear.
Methods This research examined how body mass index (BMI) and six indices of functional fitness (i.e., lower and upper body strength, lower and upper body flexibility, coordination [based on agility and balance], and aerobic endurance) relate to five psychological measures that could mirror PWB (i.e., resilience, mental well-being, optimism, life satisfaction, and happiness). Thirty-nine older adults (60–94 years; two-thirds female) were examined with the Fullerton Functional Fitness Test (FFFT) after completing five psychometric instruments.
Results Data were analyzed with correlations, ordinary least squares regressions, and regularized (elastic net) regressions, calculating the Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold (LMG) indices of the relative importance of the six FFFT components separately for the five psychological measures. Results revealed that BMI, upper body strength, and upper body flexibility were the least significant predictors of PWB. In contrast, endurance, complex movement coordination, and lower body flexibility emerged as the most significant predictors. Still, lower body strength correlated moderately positively with all PWB indices, and similarly, upper body flexibility with resilience, mental wellbeing, and happiness.
Conclusions These findings should stimulate research on the mechanism connecting functional fitness with PWB in older adults. Further, apart from their novelty, the findings could be valuable in providing directions for physical fitness intervention programs targeting mental and physical health for older people.},

	abstract = {Pornography is used worldwide, and 3\% of individuals may experience problematic pornography use (PPU, i.e. poorly controlled use resulting in significant distress and negative consequences). Therefore, instruments gauging PPU are needed in nation-specific languages. This study aimed to validate a modified version of the Problematic Pornography Consumption Scale-6 (PPCS-6) in the Serbian language among 1413 adults (52.9\% males) aged from 18 to 54 (Mage = 24.96, SD = 4.46). Exploratory factor analysis on the sample’s random half yielded a single factor explaining 43\% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis on the sample’s other half revealed an acceptable model fit. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) was acceptable. The scale exhibited configural and partial metric invariance across genders and convergent validity. Latent profile analysis identified that 8.1\% of the participants were at risk of experiencing PPU. In comparison, this value was 9.6\% based on a calculated cutoff score (≥ 19) with acceptable values (.69 and .96) of sensitivity and specificity. To conclude, the Serbian modified version of the PPCS-6 appears to be a valid and reliable scale for screening PPU.},
